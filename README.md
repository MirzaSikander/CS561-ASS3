Adversarial Search War simulation game


In this project, bots play the War simulation game using Greedy (Minimax with cut-off depth = 1), Minimax and Alpha-Beta pruning algorithms. The original idea of this game is from http://www.cool-ai.com/minimax.alpha-beta/minimax.alpha-beta.homework.pdf. The game is played on the graph. Each node (a city) contains resources. The goal of this game is to capture more resources than the opponent.
